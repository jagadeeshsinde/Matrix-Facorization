# Matrix-Facorization
Latent factor model will use the correlations: among stock prices, news articles, and between stock prices and news articles to make daily predictions of stocks most of which are not published in any news article. 
Latent factor model tries to predict the closing price by characterizing both stocks and news on, say, 10 to 20 factors inferred from the patterns. 
Matrix Factorization is best realization of latent factor model.
We have utilized appropriate regularization mechanisms to address the overfitting problem 
Implemented a generalized ADMM algorithm for optimization.
